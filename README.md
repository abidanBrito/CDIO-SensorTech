# SENSORTECH - ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE

![Project_Logo](/Sprint2/img/projectLogo.png)

Electronic prototype to **monitor and control several environmental magnitudes** through the usage of self-implemented sensors on the Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev.

## CONTEXT

This is a team effort for our first semester class CDIO. This project follows an **agile software development approach** (SCRUM).

## TECH / FRAMEWORKS USED

### Electronic devices and components

*   Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev Board.
*   Adafruit ADS1115 16-bit ADC.
*   Humidity sensor.
*   Protoboard.
*   Resistors.

## SYSTEM DESIGN

### Sofware Architecture - Codebase (TO BE UPDATED)

## FEATURES

### Implemented 

*   Humidity sensor.
*   Salinity sensor (basic implementation via electrical conductivity).

### Work in progress

*   Temperature sensor (testing).
*   Hibernation (deep sleep mode).

### To be done (COMING SOON)

*   Automated Testing.
*   Semiautomatic calibration (based on user interaction).

## DOCUMENTATION

It can be found in the form of a PDF file, for each and every Sprint, accordingly. Refer to the latest Sprint directory for an up-to-date documentation.
