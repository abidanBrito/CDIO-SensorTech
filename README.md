### IMPLEMENTED SENSOR TECHNOLOGY

* **Humidity**.
* **Salinity** (basic implementation via electrical conductivity).

### WORK IN PROGRESS

* **Temperature** sensor (testing).
* Hibernation.

### TO BE DONE (coming soon)

* Automated Testing.
* Semiautomatic calibration (based on user interaction).
