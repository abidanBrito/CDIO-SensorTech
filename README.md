### IMPLEMENTED SENSOR TECHNOLOGY

*   **Humidity**.
*   **Salinity** (basic implementation via electrical conductivity).

### WORK IN PROGRESS

*   **Temperature** sensor (testing).
*   Hibernation.

### TO BE DONE (coming soon)

*   Automated Testing.
*   Semiautomatic calibration (based on user interaction).
